Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
Example 3:


Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
 

Constraints:

The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
 

Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

思路：
这题使用快慢指针算法判断是否为环形链表。
- 每次循环，慢指针next一次，快指针next两次
- 如果快指针next返回null 不是环形链表
- 如果快指针追上了慢指针(slow==fast)，说明是环形链表
